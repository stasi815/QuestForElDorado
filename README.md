Person who is infected with a deadly disease that will kill them in a manner of days. They hear of a tree that possesses a fruit that can cure anything. The fabeled tree exists in a land that is the fabeled city of gold, El Dorado. But greed will prevent people from finding it. However, his goal isn't for the city, but for the cure to his disease... At least he thinks so. He will be challenged along the way by people who have clues to bring them back riches. He is told that if he were to give in to the greed, that the city will curse him to a fate worse than death. He becomes unsure of himself. Once he is cured, will he just be greedy? Is lying to the people who are greedy for riches going about this quest in the right way? He might live, but he'd be known as a liar, a cheat, and other derogatory names.
